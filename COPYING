RedRug depends on Redcarpet, which is distributed under the terms of the ISC
License.  The ISC License is a copyfree license.

RedRug also depends on Versionize, which is distributed under the terms of the
same licenses as RedRug.  That's awfully convenient.

See http://copyfree.org for more information about copyfree licensing in
general, and about the COIL, DPL, and ISC License in particular.

See https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet for more information about Redcarpet.  See

See http://fossrec.com/u/apotheon/redrug for more information about RedRug.

See coil.txt for the text of the COIL and dpl.txt for the text of the DPL.
