# redrug

The redcarpet library can be a bit cumbersome to use, and redrug aims to rectify this problem by wrapping it with simpler interfaces for common use cases.

## Command Line Usage

The redrug gem provides a `redrug` command line utility that takes a Markdown formatted file as input and translates it into HTML, dumping the results to standard output.  The usual approach would be to use a redirect to send the output to a persistent file instead:

    $ redrug filename.md > filename.html

This translates the contents of a Markdown formatted file, `filename.md`, into HTML, then writes that HTML into a file called `filename.html`.
